Common Mockserver


Introduction
============

    Common Mockserver is a tool that can make your mockserver development more efficiently.
  Through a simple configuration, you can generate a mockserver conveniently.

    The mockserver can simulate servers which use socket (tcp or udp) as the communication
  mode. And use protobuffer or thrift (binary or compact) as the protocol mode.
